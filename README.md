# Learning Ansible

i should populate this, but my system was reset 
and now i don't have my templates
.
.
.
and as always, i am lazy.

why do something that will take me 2 minutes to type manually,
when i have a semi-automatic method that takes 20 minutes and 5 tries to set up?

(i haven't set it up yet)

***

honestly i could have just finished typing my usual stuff in this time...

or even just copied and pasted it...
